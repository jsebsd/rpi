The file titled "trial1.py" was my attempt to create a program that could recognise the difference between someone laying on the floor
and someone walking or standing around. 

When you try to run it, you will see that an error comes up, and I spend weeks trying to solve this error. Alas, I couldnt. I still present
my code, to hopefully show what I intended to do, and in my dissertation I will talk about this in more depth.
